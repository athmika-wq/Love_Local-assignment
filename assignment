Problem: Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

# Solution  1 : || Time complexity ---> O(n)    || Space complexity --> O(n) 


def length_of_last_word(s):
    words = s.split()        # "   fly me   to   the moon  "  converted to ---> [fly,me,to,the,moon]
    if words:
        return len(words[len(words) - 1])   # here we are finding lentgh of last word that is moon,
                                            # it can also coded as, return  len(words[-1])
    else:
        return 0

print(length_of_last_word("Hello World"))  # Output: 5
print(length_of_last_word("   fly me   to   the moon  "))  # Output: 4
print(length_of_last_word("luffy is still joyboy"))  # Output: 6


Explaination:
# This function works by splitting the input string s into a list of words, then returning the length of the last word.
# If the list of words is empty (which means the input string s was empty or contained only spaces), it returns 0.

Time complexity ---> O(n) n is the length of the input string. This is because the split() function goes through the entire string once, which takes linear time.

Space complexity --> O(n) because in the worst-case scenario (a string with no spaces), the split() function would create a list with one element that is the entire string, which requires linear space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Solution  2 : || Time complexity ---> O(n)    || Space complexity --> O(1)

def length_of_last_word1(s):
    length = 0
    i = len(s) - 1

    # Skip trailing spaces
    while i >= 0 and s[i] == ' ':
        i -= 1

    # Count the length of the last word
    while i >= 0 and s[i] != ' ':
        length += 1
        i -= 1

    return length

print(length_of_last_word("Hello World"))  # Output: 5
print(length_of_last_word("   fly me   to   the moon  "))  # Output: 4
print(length_of_last_word("luffy is still joyboy"))  # Output: 6


Explaination:

First, we set up two variables: length is initialized to 0 (this will hold the length of the last word) and i is set to the index of the last character in the string.

Next, we start a loop where we move backwards through the string, skipping any trailing spaces. We do this by checking if the character at the current index i is a space (’ '), and if it is, we decrement i.

Once we encounter a non-space character, we start another loop. In this loop, we continue moving backwards through the string, but this time we increment length for each non-space character we encounter. We keep doing this until we encounter a space or reach the beginning of the string.

Finally, we return length, which by now holds the length of the last word in the string

Time complexity ---> O(n) it may need to look at every character in the string in the worst case.

Space complexity --> O(1) meaning it uses a fixed amount of space regardless of the size of the string.

Problem: Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST

# Solution  1 : || Time complexity ---> O(n)    || Space complexity --> O(1)

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # Store the values of p and q
        p_val = p.val
        q_val = q.val

        # Start from the root node of the tree
        node = root

        # Traverse the tree
        while node:
            # Value of ancestor/parent node.
            parent_val = node.val

            # If both p and q are greater than parent, go to the right of the tree
            if p_val > parent_val and q_val > parent_val:
                node = node.right
            # If both p and q are lesser than parent, go to the left of the tree
            elif p_val < parent_val and q_val < parent_val:
                node = node.left
            # We have found the common ancestor node, as p and q are split between two sides
            else:
                return node


#### code for calling above method with one test case #####
# Construct the BST from the list [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
root = TreeNode(6)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(8)
root.left.left = TreeNode(0)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.left = TreeNode(7)
root.right.right = TreeNode(9)
root.left.right.left = TreeNode(3)
root.left.right.right = TreeNode(5)

# Create the Solution object
sol = Solution()

# Call the function with p = 2 and q = 8
p = TreeNode(2)
q = TreeNode(8)
print(sol.lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q).val)  # Output: 6

# Call the function with p = 2 and q = 4
p = TreeNode(2)
q = TreeNode(4)
print(sol.lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q).val)  # Output: 2

Explaination:

This function starts at the root node of the BST, then traverses the tree based on the rule of BST: 
it uses a while loop to traverse the tree
if both nodes p and q are to the right of the parent, we move to the right of the BST; 
if both nodes p and q are to the left of the parent, we move to the left of the BST; 
otherwise, we’ve found the node which is the common ancestor to nodes p and q

Time complexity ---> O(n) n is the number of nodes in the BST. In the worst case, we might have to visit all the nodes of the BST.

Space complexity --> O(1) because this approach only uses a constant amount of space, regardless of the size of the input tree.

Hard 2

Problem:   You are given a string s. You can convert s to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.
           Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

Solution 1:  || Time complexity ---> O(n)    || Space complexity --> O(n)

def shortest_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    # Concatenate the original string, a special character, and the reversed string
    l = s + "#" + s[::-1]
    
    # Initialize the prefix function as a list of zeros with the same length as l
    prefix_function = [0] * len(l)
    
    # Initialize a variable j to 0
    j = 0
    
    # Compute the prefix function for the string l
    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        # If the current character doesn't match the character at index j, move j back to the previous longest prefix
        while j > 0 and l[i] != l[j]:
            j = prefix_function[j - 1]
        
        # If the current character matches the character at index j, increment j
        if l[i] == l[j]:
            j += 1
        
        # Store the length of the longest prefix up to the current position
        prefix_function[i] = j
    
    # Return the shortest palindrome by adding the reverse of the remaining part of the string s 
    # (from the position indicated by the last value of the prefix function to the end) to the beginning of the original string s
    return s[prefix_function[-1]:][::-1] + s


print(shortest_palindrome("aacecaaa"))  # Output: "aaacecaaa"
print(shortest_palindrome("abcd"))      # Output: "dcbabcd"

Explaination:

It uses the concept of a prefix function which is commonly used in string matching algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
Concatenate String: The function first concatenates the original string s, a special character that doesn’t appear in the string (in this case ‘#’), and the reversed string s[::-1]. This new string is stored in l.
Initialize Variables: It initializes the prefix_function as a list of zeros with the same length as l, and a variable j to 0
Compute Prefix Function: It then enters a loop to compute the prefix function for the string l. The prefix function for a position i in the string is the length of the longest proper prefix of the substring that ends at i that is also a suffix of this substring.
Return Shortest Palindrome: Finally, it returns the shortest palindrome by adding the reverse of the remaining part of the string s (from the position indicated by the last value of the prefix function to the end) to the beginning of the original string s.

Time complexity ---> O(n) n is the length of the string. This is because it computes the prefix function in a single pass through the string, and each operation inside the loop takes constant time.
Space complexity --> O(n) because it stores the prefix function for the entire string, which requires linear space. The input string itself is not counted towards the space complexity, as it is an input to the function.

Solution 2:  || Time complexity ---> O(n)    || Space complexity --> O(n)

# Define the method to find the shortest palindrome
    def shortestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty string 'prefix' and a counter 'i' set to 1
        prefix = ""
        i = 1
        # Enter a loop where it checks if the string 'prefix + s' is a palindrome
        while not self.ispalindrome(prefix + s):
            # If it's not a palindrome, add the 'i'-th character from the end of 's' to 'prefix' and increment 'i'
            prefix += s[-i]
            i += 1
        # Repeat this process until 'prefix + s' is a palindrome
        # Finally, return 'prefix + s', which is the shortest possible palindrome
        return prefix + s
    
    # Define the method to check if a string is a palindrome
    def ispalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # A string is a palindrome if it is equal to its reverse
        return s == s[::-1]

print(shortest_palindrome("aacecaaa"))  # Output: "aaacecaaa"
print(shortest_palindrome("abcd"))      # Output: "dcbabcd"

Explaination:

ispalindrome: This method checks if a given string s is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the string with its reverse. If they are the same, it returns True, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns False.
shortestPalindrome: This method finds the shortest palindrome by adding characters in front of the input string s.
It starts with an empty string prefix and a counter i set to 1. 
It enters a loop where it checks if the string prefix + s is a palindrome.
If it’s not a palindrome, it adds the i-th character from the end of s to prefix and increments i.
It repeats this process until prefix + s is a palindrome. Finally, it returns prefix + s, which is the shortest possible palindrome.


Time complexity ---> O(n^2) n is the length of the string. This is because for each character in the string, it constructs a new string and checks if it’s a palindrome.Each of these operations takes O(n) so it will become O(n^2).
Space complexity --> O(n) because it creates a new string prefix that can be as long as the input string s. The input string itself is not counted towards the space complexity, as it is an input to the function.
